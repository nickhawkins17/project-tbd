Contributions are welcome. Please document a "New Issue" for all contributions or suggestions.

If you'd like to implement improvements, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project.
2. Implement improvements in a new branch prefixed by one of the following: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `docs/`, or `release/`.
3. Run formatting and linting (`make ruff`).
4. Write tests as appropriate and ensure all existing tests pass (`make test`).
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add a new feature"`).
6. Push to the branch (`git push -u origin feature/new_feature`).
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR).
